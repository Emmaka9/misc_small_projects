Creating a comprehensive README file for your server application is crucial for onboarding new developers, documenting the setup process, and outlining the application's functionality. Here's a suggested README structure and content for your Python HTTP server that handles session management and cookie operations:

# Python HTTP Server for Session and Cookie Management

This Python HTTP server demonstrates basic session management and cookie handling through a simple web interface. It allows users to set and retrieve cookies and provides dynamic content based on session information.

## Features

- **Dynamic HTML Content**: Serves HTML content from a separate file and inserts session messages dynamically.
- **Cookie Management**: Allows users to set and retrieve cookies through a web form. Includes input sanitization to ensure security and compliance with HTTP standards.
- **Session Tracking**: Tracks user sessions and counts visits using cookies.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You will need Python 3 installed on your system to run this server. Python 3.6 or later is recommended. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Emmaka9/misc_small_projects.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   After cloning the repository, change into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd cookieSessionServer
   ```

3. **Project Structure**

   Ensure your project directory has the following structure:

   ```
   /cookieSessionServer/
   │
   ├── server.py (your Python script)
   └── templates/
       └── index.html (your HTML file)
   ```

### Running the Server

Execute the server script using Python:

```bash
python server.py
```

The server will start running on `http://localhost:8000`. You can access it using any web browser.

## Usage

- **Set a Cookie**: Navigate to `http://localhost:8000/`. Use the form provided to input a cookie key and value, then submit the form to set the cookie.
- **Get Cookies**: Click the "Get Cookies" button on the home page to display all stored cookies.
